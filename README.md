# Monopoly

Part of an OOP in C++ course at university. The final project was a test to demonstrate knowledge learnt during the course. I designed a version of UK Monopoly for 1 user-controlled player, and 1-3 simple computer controlled players. There is no trading but most of the remaining features of the game are included. It is fully text-based.
